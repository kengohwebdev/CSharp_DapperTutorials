1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
It is undefined and the code will get stuck in an infinite loop.


2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
In C#, âˆž represents positive infinity or negative infinity

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
range?



4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
int x = 0;
int y = 0;
Postfix increment x= y++;   // x = 0, y = 1
Prefix increment  x = ++x;  // x = 1, y = 1

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop
statement?
break   : Terminates the smallest enclosing loop such as switch statements. for or while loop.
continue : Skips the rest of the loop statement and starts the next iteration of the loop to take place.
           Not used with the switch statement, but in the while loop and for loop.
return   : Terminates the execution of the method in which it appears and returns control to the calling method.


6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
Ititialization : Execute first and only once. Usually the variable is declared and initialized here.
Condition : The condition is evaluated as boolean expression and continue if true until it is runs false.
            The statements inside the for loop are executed.
Iterator  : Then, the iterator statement is executed which usually changes the value of the initialized value.
            Again, the condition is evaluated. 
            The process continue until the condition evaluated to flase and terminates the for loop. 

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
The = operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.
The == operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
No, invalid expression term ;


9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
The switch cases can use pattern matching, so instead of using the "default" keyword, the match-all pattern can be used. It is just the "_" sign (underscore)
It replaces the default keyword to signify that it should match anything if reached.

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach
statement?
Key value pairs condition exist. The IEnumerable interface permits enumeration by using a foreach loop as long as it has key value pairs.
